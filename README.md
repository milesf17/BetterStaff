# BetterStaff
### By. Milesf17

BetterStaff is a comprehensive Minecraft plugin designed to empower server staff members with a suite of advanced tools and utilities. This plugin enhances the capabilities of your server's moderation team, allowing them to efficiently go into staff duty, set themselves to Anonymous mode to secretly manage the server and maintain a smooth and fair gameplay experience. Whether your server is large or small, BetterStaff provides the essential features needed to improve the staff experience.

## Features:

1. Staff mode:
Staff members can go to staff mode so that other players can know if the staff members are on duty
2. Anonymous mode (SOON):
Staff members can go Anonymous to efficiently handle the server without interruption from other players. By turning into Anonymous, the staff member name will be hidden for other players which provides a great gameplay experience when monitoring players activity
3. Online staff team list:
Check which staff members are online by simply running a single command. The list is split into groups for each staff group. Players can also see who is in Staff mode on the list.
4. Customization:
The plugin can be easily configured how you want, whether it is the Staff mode or online staff list or messages. Everything can be done how you want!
